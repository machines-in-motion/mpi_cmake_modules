#   This looks for any files ending with .urdf.xacro in the [package_root]/xacro
#   folder. Then it calls the xacro command on each and every file found.
#   It then declare a target whith the xacro command.
#
#   .. note::
#       This all boils down to the following fact,
#       at compile time the [package_root]/urdf/*.urdf files are going to
#       be compiled from the [package_root]/xacro/*.urdf.xacro files.
